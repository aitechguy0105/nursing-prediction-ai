    "* Second, specify an explicit <code>time_of_day</code> at which predictions are run each day. \n",
    "* Valid prediction times are times for which two conditions hold: the patient was in the census from prior night, and the patient was not transferred out before <code>time_of_day</code>\n",

    "This suggests that the easiest way to build prediction times is from our stays: \n",
