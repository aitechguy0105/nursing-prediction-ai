Meanwhile Ms. Noble was extrememly verbally inappropriate with staff and Weekend supervisor <span class='yellow'>screaming</span> that she needed oxyen and had no pants to return home in.,2021-01-10 11:41:52.983,21,"[(2434, 2443)]","On Friday this writer worked deligently on setting up transportation for Ms. Noble to return home. Typically Freedom does not provide transportation home but was willing to make the exception since she had to admit so far away from home. I spoke briefly with her case manager at Freedom about authorization that Acess to Care transport needed since she lives over 100 miles away. Was advised the casemanger did not have access to provide the authorization needed. 
This writer was able to get a representative at Freedom on late Friday and spent a good hour on the phone with them. He told me that the authorization was given and he was sending the documents over to Access to transport. Advised me to give Access to Care a call on Sat morning to follow up and see who they staffed it with. Ms. Noble was informed as well on Friday regarding the status. I called Acess to Care twice this morning and spoke with two different staff members and both told me the same information. They do not have anything on file for her for transportation and that they do not handle it by paper documents that the Freedom rep has to call them and do it with them over the phone. I also left a voice message for the supervisor that was also involved on Friday that Ms. Noble reached out to. Jasmine 1800-401-2740 ext 19151 with no return call. I called the Freedom 1800-401-2740 number x 3 times this morning and received voice mails because it is Sat, I have left messages with the reference number the gentleman gave me last night 2021 010801632840 in hopes that someone may be checking the voicemails over the weekend. Our admission rep at my facility has also provided me with the on-call nurse's number for Freedom and I have left her a detailed message as well at 813-377-7634. I have spoken with Ms. Noble and she has no back up plan or finances to cover the transport home. The quotes that I did get for transport were between $700-800 and she has made it very clear she cannot afford and is not going to pay that. This writer recieved a return call from Jennifer the nurse on call for Freedom whom was very helpful after a few hours she was able to confirm with her supervisior that she could give the authorization and after several calls was able to get the transportation established with Angies Taxi with pick up at 4:45PM with a 2 hour window. Meanwhile Ms. Noble was extrememly verbally inappropriate with staff and Weekend supervisor screaming that she needed oxyen and had no pants to return home in. Staff provided pants for Ms. Noble. This writer has been working on Ms. Noble's discharge since admission. It was confirmed during UR meeting and several times prior to DC that she was not meeting criteria for the oxygen. This writer spoke with Ms. Noble days prior to her discharge and inquired if she was using the oxygen she stated that yes she is using in and no one has made an attempt to wean her off. Informed Ms. Noble that if she did not meet criteria for oxygen that it would not be covered and it may not be clinically safe for her to use. On Sat this writer spoke with the Supervior and asked for her to have the nurse check Ms. Noble's oxygen stats without the oxygen and upon exertion to see if she drops 87% or below. According to the report back Ms. Noble was stating at 99% on room air with no oxygen, exerting herself, moving about her room and physically excerting herself yelling at staff. Nurse was able to finally calm her down and she did accept that she was not meeting the criteria for the oxygen. This writer advised that if she does need it in the future she can privately pay for it or her home health or PCP can order it for her as she will be recieving home health. This writer also spoke with the Therapy Director on Saturday and did confirm that patient was not using oxygen with PT/OT according to their therapy notes. This writer received a call from weekend supervisior as Ms. Noble's taxi arrived that she was not leaving without her negative covid test as her apartment had to have a copy. A copy was provided to Ms. Noble to take home with her. Prior to DC this writer spoke with her apartment supervisor inquiring what criteria was needed in order for her to return home and she stated they did not need anything as they are not an ALF or ILF. Ms. Noble left the facility approximately 6:25PM. ",2771868,* Social Services Note,['screaming']
